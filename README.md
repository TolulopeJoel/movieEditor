# Scene-Rec

SceneRec is a tool that lets users search a vast database of movie subtitles to find scenes with specific lines of dialogue. By simplifying the process of locating and compiling movie clips, SceneRec saves time and effort for editors, content creators, and movie enthusiasts.

### Motivation

The idea for this project was born from a moment of realization while watching a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8UYQkXR8Zd/) on Instagram. I couldn't help but think about the huge effort it must have taken for the editor to find and stitch together movie scenes that matched specific phrases. 

Manually filtering through countless films to find the right words is overwhelming and extremely time-consuming.

This tool aims to make the creative process more efficient, enabling editors, content creators, and movie enthusiasts to bring their ideas to life with few keystrokes. In the future, the software can create a video from the default recommended scenes automatically.
