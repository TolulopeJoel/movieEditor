# Scene-Rec

## Project Description

SceneRec is a tool that lets users get movie clip recommendations for phrases or sentences. It intelligently matches user inputs to complete sentences spoken in various movie scenes. SceneRec saves time and effort for editors, content creators, and video enthusiasts.

## Motivation

The idea for this project was born from a moment of realisation while watching a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8UYQkXR8Zd/) on Instagram. I couldn't help but think about the huge effort it must have taken for the editor to find and stitch together movie scenes that matched specific phrases. 

Manually filtering through countless films to find the right words is overwhelming and extremely time-consuming.

This tool aims to make the creative process more efficient, enabling editors, content creators, and video enthusiasts to bring their ideas to life with few keystrokes. In the future, the software will be able to create a video from the default recommended scenes automatically.
