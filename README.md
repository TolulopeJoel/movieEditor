# movieEditor

Movie Scene Clip Suggester is a python app that allows users to find and retrieve movie scenes based on specific phrases or sentences. The algorithm searches through subtitles and matches user inputs to complete sentences, even if the text spans multiple subtitles and movies.

### Motivation

This project is inspired by a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8UYQkXR8Zd/) I watched on Instagram. I imagine how tedious it is for an editor to manually search for movie scenes with specific phrases and stitch them together. To save time and effort, this software allows users to type the dialogue they want, and it automatically recommends movie scenes clips for different phrases in the dialogue.
